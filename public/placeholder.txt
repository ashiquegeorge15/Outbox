To fix the missing logo files error, you need to add the following files to this directory:

1. favicon.ico - A small icon for the browser tab (16x16 or 32x32 pixels)
2. logo192.png - A 192x192 pixel logo for PWA icons
3. logo512.png - A 512x512 pixel logo for PWA icons

You can create these files using any image editing software, or download placeholder icons from sources like:
- https://favicon.io/
- https://www.flaticon.com/

Once you add these files, the console errors about missing manifest icons will disappear.
